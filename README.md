I was curious about the video game sales by country, what publisher was most successful in which country and the genre of video game. 
I knew that Nintendo was a powerhouse but I wasn't aware on what spectrum that it is. 

I would say that Nintendo is the most popular gaming publisher/console creater across the world. Xbox isn't as popular as you would assume. 
from a consumer standpoint, nintendo is more affordable and attainable than a Xbox or PS5
